/**
 * Cross-compiles the managed WezTerm fork for Windows from a POSIX host.
 *
 * Three host quirks make a plain `cargo build --target` fail, so each one is
 * handled explicitly rather than left for the next person to rediscover:
 *
 * 1. An activated Conda environment exports CC/CXX/CFLAGS/AR/RANLIB pointing at
 *    a *Linux* cross compiler. Those are picked up by cc-rs and openssl-src for
 *    the Windows target, so the environment is rebuilt from scratch and the
 *    mingw compilers are named per target instead.
 * 2. `libssh-rs-sys` emits MSVC library names (`libcrypto`/`libssl`) for every
 *    Windows target, while `openssl-src` under mingw produces `libcrypto.a` and
 *    `libssl.a`. GNU ld then looks for `liblibcrypto.a`. OpenSSL is therefore
 *    built first and the expected names are provided as symlinks.
 * 3. The fork resolver looks for the executables in `target/release`, so the
 *    Windows binaries are staged next to their POSIX counterparts.
