 *
 *   - the route tables are the dispatch code itself (a scan of this file makes
 *     a table row without a dispatch block, or a block without a row, fail);
 *   - the remote availability report says "implemented but this channel does
 *     not route it" for the members P0-C must add routes for, while the
 *     in-process report is unchanged;
 *   - the implemented-unreachable set is exactly the P0-C work list — a new
 *     member that is implemented but unrouted changes this list and appears in
 *     the report without anyone maintaining a checklist.
