/**
 * The five failure kinds, at the point where they are decided.
 *
 * Before this, every failure left as `-32602` with a string, so a remote consumer
 * could not tell "there is no such method" from "this runtime cannot" from "your
 * argument is wrong" from "policy says no" from "something broke" — five
 * situations with five different correct reactions. These tests assert on codes
 * and structured data only; matching on message text is the thing being removed,
 * so it must not reappear in the tests that guard it.
