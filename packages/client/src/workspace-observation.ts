/**
 * WG4 Phase 1: the secret-safe boundary around workspace observation facts.
 *
 * Ownership boundaries (from mainline plan §56.9):
 *
 * - `WorkspaceFilesController` owns the watcher lifecycle and catalog
 *   invalidation; it must not write the Work Graph or generate workspace
 *   provenance.
 * - A new `WorkspaceChangeAuditor` (Phase 2+) is the sole production owner of
 *   workspace observation: baseline, reconciliation, expected-mutation
 *   matching and observation health.
 * - `work-graph.ts` stays the only Work Graph writer.
 * - `DriftEvaluator` is the only production writer of `drift.finding_opened`
 *   (Phase 4); nothing else may open a drift finding.
 *
 * This module is the contract's enforcement point: `assertSecretSafeObservation`
 * rejects any forbidden field, so a future hint/auditor that accidentally
 * carries content, a diff or command text fails here rather than leaking into
 * the durable graph.
