/**
 * WG4 Phase 2: the WorkspaceChangeAuditor — the sole production owner of
 * workspace observation (§56.9).
 *
 * Ownership boundaries (mainline plan §56.9):
 *
 * - `WorkspaceFilesController` owns the watcher lifecycle and catalog
 *   invalidation; it must NOT write the Work Graph or generate workspace
 *   provenance. It hands every fs.watch event to the auditor as a hint.
 * - This auditor is the ONLY production owner of workspace observation:
 *   baseline, hint coalescing, reconciliation, expected-mutation matching and
 *   observation health. It turns hints into `ConfirmedWorkspaceChange` facts —
 *   and only reconciliation can do that, never a raw watcher event.
 * - `work-graph.ts` stays the only Work Graph writer (Phase 4 wires the
 *   confirmed changes into the graph; this module does not write it).
 * - `DriftEvaluator` is the only writer of `drift.finding_opened` (Phase 4).
 *
 * The three-problem split from §56.9:
 *
 *   1. "the filesystem changed" → a hint (`WorkspaceObservation`), health
 *      included.
 *   2. "who changed it" → attribution decided by `attributionFor`, driven by
 *      an expected-mutation registry (Phase 3) or none (unattributed).
 *   3. "does it violate a goal" → drift (Phase 4, not here).
 *
 * A watcher event is only a hint: it must survive debounce + reconciliation
 * before it becomes a confirmed change. A degraded/unavailable watcher cannot
 * produce confirmed facts without a full reconciliation, and an indeterminate
 * window marks its confirmed changes indeterminate instead of forcing
 * attribution.
 *
 * Secret-safe: confirmed changes carry only workspace-relative paths,
 * operation types, correlation and health — `assertSecretSafeObservation`
 * rejects content/diff/command/result fields at a single point.
