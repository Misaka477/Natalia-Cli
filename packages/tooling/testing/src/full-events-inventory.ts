/**
 * The RINA study's acceptance #1 as a LIVE INVENTORY: every content
 * read of the session's full event array is named, counted and
 * CLASSIFIED — the study's taxonomy enforced by drift detection rather
 * than by hope. A new read without a deliberate inventory edit goes
 * red; a changed count — including a count that fell to zero — goes
 * red too (the table tracks reality in both directions: a file that
 * stopped reading the array moved the surface as much as one that
 * started).
 *
 * The classes and their notes are the acceptance itself:
 *   explicit-history  — behind ensure/complete in the same function
 *   state-first       — the fact fold answers, the resident array is
 *                       only the emergency belt (the boundary's shape)
 *   paged-mechanism   — the completion/window machinery's own reads
 *   derivation        — a change-signal/revision over what is resident
 *   fold-direct       — NAMED DEBT: a pre-facts domain folding the
 *                       resident journal (correctness under a fast
 *                       attach awaits its fact twin — counted, never
 *                       silently assumed)
