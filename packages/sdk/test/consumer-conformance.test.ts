/**
 * Consumer conformance fixture (mainline plan P12).
 *
 * This is the test an externally built UI author effectively runs: it drives a
 * real runtime over the real HTTP transport using **only** the packages §2.1
 * allows a consumer to depend on —
 *
 *   @natalia/contracts   types
 *   @natalia/sdk         talking to a runtime
 *   @natalia/view-store  turning events into displayable state
 *   @natalia/client      public exports only (to host the runtime under test)
 *
 * It deliberately imports nothing from `@natalia/runtime`, `@natalia/session`,
 * `@natalia/tools`, any package internal, or any UI framework. `guard:imports`
 * enforces most of that statically; this proves the surface is actually
 * *sufficient*, which no static rule can show.
 *
 * If a future change makes a UI impossible to build from this surface, this test
 * is where it should fail — not in someone's project.
 *
 * `@natalia/transport/host` is used to stand the server up. That is the one
 * host-side import, and it is what a consumer would replace with a URL pointing
 * at a runtime somebody else runs.
