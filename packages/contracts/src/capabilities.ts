/**
 * What a runtime is required to do, and how a consumer finds out what else it can.
 *
 * `RuntimeClient` has 87 members and only eight of them are required, so on its own
 * the type says almost nothing: an implementer cannot tell what the minimum is, and
 * a consumer has to feature-detect nearly every call. Worse, `optional` cannot
 * express *why* something is absent — "this runtime does not do terminals" and
 * "nobody has implemented this yet" look identical from the outside, and a query
 * that returns an empty array looks like "no data".
 *
 * This module says all three things explicitly:
 *
 *   - `REQUIRED_RUNTIME_MEMBERS` is the minimum. A runtime providing these is
 *     usable: start a session, submit a turn, cancel it, read state, answer a
 *     prompt.
 *   - `RUNTIME_CAPABILITY_GROUPS` assigns every remaining member to a capability,
 *     so "which parts of the API does this runtime have" is answerable by group
 *     rather than one member at a time. A member that belongs to no group fails
 *     typecheck, so the classification cannot rot as members are added.
 *   - `UNIMPLEMENTED_QUERIES` names the surfaces that exist, are wired end to end,
 *     and have no production writer yet. They answer with an empty result today,
 *     which a consumer would otherwise read as "nothing recorded".
 *
 * `describeRuntimeCapabilities()` derives the report from an instance instead of
 * asking the implementer to declare it, because a hand-maintained declaration is
 * one more thing that can disagree with the code.
 */
