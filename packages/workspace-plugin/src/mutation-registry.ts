/**
 * WG4 Phase 3: the expected-mutation registry (§56.9).
 *
 * "工具开始时由 mutation registry 注册 expected mutation，至少包含 sessionID、
 * episodeID、turnID、callID、operation identity、授权路径范围和预期操作类型；
 * 工具成功后将实际变化与该记录匹配。"
 *
 * A tool call that may change the workspace registers what it is about to do
 * BEFORE running: the turn/call identity, the authorized path scope and the
 * expected operation. When the watcher later produces a hint for a path, the
 * auditor asks the registry whether any expected mutation covers it. A hit
 * gives the confirmed change a reliable identity (turnID+callID or operationID)
 * and an `origin`; a miss stays unattributed external/unknown.
 *
 * The registry is the secret-safe bridge between "the filesystem changed" and
 * "who changed it": it correlates paths and operations only — no file content,
 * no command text, no tool arguments or results ever enter it.
