/**
 * Linux confinement (sandbox study §6, decision 25, phase 1: landlock +
 * rlimit family) — the exec primitive's front wrapper, consumed through the
 * `confinement-exec` native binary in `../native`.
 *
 * The vocabulary and the enforcement dialect follow dsh's local sandbox
 * (`devref/deepseek-harness/packages/sandbox/`): the three-mode file axis,
 * the always-writable `/dev/null`, and the fail-closed rule that a missing
 * or unusable backend never degrades into running unconstrained. Two
 * deliberate differences, both recorded in the study: this wrapper adds the
 * rlimit family dsh lacks (the resource-exhaustion face), and macOS/Windows
 * rungs are not here yet — on a platform without a backend, only
 * `danger-full-access` remains usable (the study's honest Windows
 * degradation).
