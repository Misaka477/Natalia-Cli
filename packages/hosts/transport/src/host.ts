/**
 * Host-side transport surface: serving a runtime, and the daemon lifecycle.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate entry point from `@natalia/transport`. Everything
 * here either opens a listening socket, mints or reads a bearer token, or
 * spawns a process, so it belongs to whoever runs the runtime — today
 * `apps/cli` — and not to a UI that merely talks to one. `guard:imports`
 * enforces that consumer-contract packages never reach this module.
