/**
 * Deterministic image downscaling for attachments.
 *
 * Why scale at admission instead of at dispatch: a dispatch-time decision has
 * to read the request's remaining byte budget, and every input to that
 * arithmetic (inline fallback, quantum size, compaction, route switch) moves
 * between requests. An image that was inlined on one request and dropped on the
 * next rewrites history, so the provider's prefix cache misses on every turn.
 * Scaling once here, against a fixed target, and persisting the result removes
 * the per-request decision entirely: the stored bytes are the attachment's
 * representation for life, and the prefix cannot move because of them.
 *
 * The target is the provider's own threshold rather than a number we invented.
 * Anthropic resamples any image whose long edge exceeds 1568px and rejects
 * anything above roughly 1.15 MP, so an image over that edge is going to be
 * resampled anyway — scaling it here costs us deterministic bytes we control
 * instead of full-size bytes the provider then reduces lossily.
