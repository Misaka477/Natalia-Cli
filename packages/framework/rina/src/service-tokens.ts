/**
 * `rina.*` as a tokenized service (architecture decisions: RINA's
 * cache/memory mechanisms belong to the Anthelia engine; the contract is a
 * token).
 *
 * Consumed engine-side today — the L1 read-cache wrap in the tool pipeline
 * and the workspace write hooks. The plugin-facing `ctx.cache` port is
 * BUILT (2026-09-25, the master plan's closure round): the base-completeness
 * criterion — a future capability must land as a plugin with zero base
 * edits — makes the port a base surface, not a consumer-gated feature. The
 * substrate's plugin controller builds the port over this token's fabric;
 * the plugin kernel declares the surface structurally and gates it by the
 * `cache` integration point.
