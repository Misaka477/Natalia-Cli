/**
 * Static constitution pre-check for WorkContract proposals and detours
 * (EI Open Question: "契约 handoff 撞 constitution — 拦在 propose 还是
 * handoff？"，决定：**拦在 propose / detour_declare（事前）**).
 *
 * A contract (or detour delta) whose scope explicitly names a path that a
 * `deny` constitution rule covers is internally inconsistent: approving it
 * would make the user commit to work the runtime will never allow, and the
 * handoff would then dead-end. Catching the contradiction at the proposal
 * point lets the model re-propose inside the existing feedback loop, before
 * the user gate ever fires — the user's approval attention is never spent on
 * a contract that cannot be executed.
 *
 * What is checked, and why only this:
 *
 * - **`scope` entries only, against `deny` rules with `appliesTo.paths`.**
 *   Scope is the declared work surface — a path token there IS a declaration
 *   that the plan touches that path, so the glob match is deterministic, no
 *   guessing about intent. Verification entries are skipped (they name
 *   read/test activities; read-vs-write is not decidable from prose), and
 *   constraints are skipped (a constraint that NAMES a deny path is the model
 *   respecting the rule, not violating it). An `approval` rule is not a
 *   contradiction (the path may be touched once the user approves at the tool
 *   gate); `warn` is prose. Tools and commandPattern anchors are deliberately
 *   not checked here: the contract text is prose, not commands, and matching
 *   it against command patterns would manufacture false contradictions. Those
 *   anchors keep their enforcement at execution time (the approval layer and
 *   the `constitution_conflict` drift finding, EI Phase 2 判定矩阵).
 *
 * Runtime-side coverage stays unchanged: even with this pre-check, a change
 * that later matches a deny rule still opens the high `constitution_conflict`
 * finding (rules can be added between propose and execution).
