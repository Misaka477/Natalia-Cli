 * what decides whether a message can be read soon, later, or not at all:
 *
 *   running          the child's driver is inside a step, so appending to its
 *                    ledger puts the message in front of the next request
 *   paused           the child is parked but its ledger is live, so the message
 *                    is appended and the child is resumed to read it
 *   no live runner   there is no ledger to append to, so the message is queued
 *                    on the record and delivered when the child next starts
 *
 * The queued case is the reason the record carries messages at all: dropping one
 * on the floor would leave the parent believing it had steered, and nothing
 * downstream would say otherwise.
