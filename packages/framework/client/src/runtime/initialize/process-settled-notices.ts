/**
 * Delivering a managed process's exit to the session that started it.
 *
 * The process plugin owns the registry and the observer that watches it, but a
 * plugin cannot write into a session: the tool context has no publishing surface,
 * and that boundary is deliberate. So the plugin publishes the observer under a
 * service name and this module — which does own sessions — subscribes to it.
 *
 * The notice lands in the ledger as a `role:"dynamic"` entry, the same shape the
 * plan pointer and the subagent settled notice use: it renders as a user message
 * rather than a system one, so appending it after the conversation does not hoist
 * anything to the top and reset the stable prefix.
