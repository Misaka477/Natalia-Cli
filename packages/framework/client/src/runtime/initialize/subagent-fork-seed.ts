 *
 * The seed is a **balanced completed-turn prefix**, which is the invariant that
 * makes it replayable: contiguous from the start of the conversation, with every
 * tool call still paired with its result, and stopping before the turn the parent
 * is in the middle of. A seed that began mid-exchange would hand the child an
 * orphaned tool result, and one that ran into the in-flight turn would show it a
 * request the parent has not answered yet.
