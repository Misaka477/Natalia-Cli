/**
 * The workspace write lock (D2: "same workspace, writes serialised").
 *
 * Parallel sessions may run turns concurrently; two of them writing the same
 * workspace at once would interleave file edits and corrupt both. The lock is
 * a promise chain — the next writer waits for the previous one to release —
 * so writers serialise in acquisition order while readers and everything else
 * stay parallel.
 *
 * The lock also keeps a lightweight activity snapshot so the runtime can tell
 * which session is currently or about to write which paths. It is observational
 * only; it never changes the serialisation guarantee.
