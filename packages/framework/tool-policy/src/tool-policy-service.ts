/**
 * The tool-policy framework service: the unique policy funnel.
 *
 * `executeOneTool` is the single place every tool call passes through, and this
 * package owns the policy evaluation half of it: the permission-rule evaluator,
 * the workspace write-path detection, the command-text extraction and the
 * hook-layer factory. The runtime host requires this service — a runtime
 * without policy enforcement is not a runtime — and constructs it directly.
 *
 * Keeping the funnel on the service channel is what later lets plugins
 * contribute policy rules and hooks through the same single writer, instead of
 * opening a second policy path.
