/**
 * Routing and settlement regressions for the interactive waiter.
 *
 * Two bugs this locks down:
 *   - a response for a recovered/stale request must be routed by the client's
 *     `sessionID` hint instead of the currently attached session;
 *   - a cancelled or expired request must settle the durable journal with a
 *     `*response` event, or the UI re-opens it on every re-attach.
