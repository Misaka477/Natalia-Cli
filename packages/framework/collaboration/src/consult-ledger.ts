/**
 * The consult ledger — the advisor pattern's measurement spine (the
 * Navi advisor plan's block D).
 *
 * The raw material already exists: the main agent asks Navi through
 * `collab_ask` (a collaboration message of kind "question" from
 * main_agent) and Navi answers with `collab_answer` (kind "answer",
 * replying to the question). This fold pairs the two into consult
 * records and folds those into the distribution the advisor policy
 * will eventually be tuned on: how often the main agent consults, how
 * long it waits, and how many asks never get answered.
 *
 * v1's outcome vocabulary is what the journal can actually express
 * today: `open` (asked, never answered) and `answered`. The advisor's
 * "declined" outcome lands with its producer (the advisor contract,
 * block B — a field with no writer is the half-wired shape this house
 * refuses), and the applied-or-ignored leg is v2 (same reason: no
 * measurable producer yet).
 *
 * Previews, never bodies: the journal keeps every entry for the audit
 * trail; a report carries bounded previews so a consult's content can
 * be eyeballed without pasting a conversation into a table.
