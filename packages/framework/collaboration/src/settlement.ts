 * left polling. The plan's study (dsh-settlement-study.zh-CN.md) proved
 * the shape against DeepSeek's harness: settle -> notice -> steer/queue,
 * with a closed reason taxonomy and the discipline written into the
 * tools ("you are told when one finishes").
 *
 * Three disciplines hold here:
 * 1. A notice is an INPUT, not a command — the model decides when to
 *    read it (the advisor contract's discipline, one layer up).
 * 2. Every notice is a durable fact — replay and audit see what the
 *    model was told, and the delivery itself journals the admitted input.
 * 3. A notice's failure degrades: a failed delivery warns and moves on,
 *    never failing the thing that settled (a crashed process must not
 *    become a failed process report because a notice could not fly).
