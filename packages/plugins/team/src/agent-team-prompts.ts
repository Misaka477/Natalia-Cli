1. Read the goal and the repository. Identify the natural subsystems (e.g. a game's battle, inventory, quest and shop systems) and the shared interface contract they all need (data structures, event schema, cross-system call surfaces).
2. Produce an ownership map: assign every file to exactly ONE task. Each task has an id, a prompt, and a writePaths domain (directories it owns). Two domains must never overlap, and no domain may be a prefix of another — disjointness is what keeps parallel work mergeable.
3. Validate the map (validateOwnershipMap): no overlapping or prefix-overlapping domains.
4. Run the fan-out: one sandboxed sub-agent per task, each limited to its own checked-out worktree and write domain.
5. Hand the PR queue to the lead reviewer.

Rules: every shared file is owned by exactly one task; shared interfaces are frozen before the fan-out; a task never writes outside its domain. Decomposition quality is the success condition — a clean ownership map is more valuable than a clever one.`;
