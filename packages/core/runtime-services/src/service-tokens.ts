/**
 * Service tokens for the contracts that cross the plugin boundary.
 *
 * These services are provided by official plugins and consumed by the runtime
 * tool pipeline (terminal controller, skills registry, MCP service, …). Their
 * tokens live here, beside the contract types in `./services`, because the
 * engine must stay free of static imports into concrete plugin packages: a
 * token is the shared vocabulary both sides already import, and the wire name
 * a plugin's manifest `provides` and `api.services.provide` speak is
 * `token.id` — one spelling, no mapping table. Engine-internal services keep
 * their tokens in their owning mechanism packages instead (see
 * `collaborationWaiter`).
 *
 * When a contract type relocates to its owning package, its token moves with
 * it; until then this file is the single home for the boundary wires.
