 * bindings; skills are deliberately absent (no fingerprint catalog exists —
 * skills are directory-discovered at runtime, and a field without a producer
 * is a stub), everything else is here.
 *
 * Plugins are referenced by identity plus the catalog's content fingerprint
 * rather than by embedding manifests: the fingerprint is the entry's content
 * hash, so a generation entry addresses exactly the content it was resolved
 * against, and the catalog itself stays the one place manifests live.
