/**
 * Per-member decision: when this call does not happen, how does the caller find out?
 *
 * Three answers, and only three:
 *
 *   - `value`   — refusing is an ordinary outcome, so the return type says it.
 *                 A caller must never have to tell "not now" apart from a broken
 *                 connection by catching, and `Promise<void>` cannot say either.
 *   - `error`   — the operation has nothing to answer with, so a refusal arrives
 *                 as `-32001` with a reason (see `failures.ts`).
 *   - `none`    — it cannot be refused for a normal reason: a pure read, a local
 *                 accessor, or an idempotent teardown.
 *
 * The table exists because the question was being answered per member, by
 * whoever wrote it, with no record. Filling it in found five members whose RPC
 * reply asserted success unconditionally — `pause`, `resume`, `selectAgent`,
 * `respondApproval`, `respondQuestion` — the same shape already fixed once for
 * `reloadConfig`.
 *
 * A member that belongs to no row fails typecheck, so a new member cannot be
 * added without someone deciding this about it.
 *
 * Refusal categories decided on 2026-08-10 that this table does *not* yet
 * produce, recorded so they are not mistaken for oversights:
 *
 *   - background sessions must refuse approval-requiring tools outright
 *     (mainline §41.6 D5.2). It is not a member: it happens inside a turn and
 *     surfaces as a tool result, not as an RPC failure.
 *   - the secure-input interlock (terminal plan TERM-M.2 I2) is implemented and
 *     refuses, but the `nativeTerminal*` members have no route yet, so its
 *     refusal is still an untyped `Error` in `packages/plugins/native-terminal`. It gets
 *     typed with those routes.
 *   - focus may not be stolen by a background session (I1) and terminals must be
 *     addressed per session (I3) — both land with multi-session. The
 *     `terminal`/`terminalSharing` members this table used to cover for them are
 *     gone: they belonged to the xterm emulator line, which is retired (no
 *     production code can create a session in it), and the live terminal line is
 *     `nativeTerminal*`.
