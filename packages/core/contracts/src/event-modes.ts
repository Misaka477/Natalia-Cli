/**
 * Event modes (interface spec §4.6, decision 6).
 *
 * An event's mode declares how its consumers treat failure, and the same
 * declaration serves the mode system and the log discipline ("同一份声明可被
 * 模式系统与日志系统核对"):
 *
 * - `emit` — observation only: a consumer's failure never propagates into the
 *   flow that published the event.
 * - `waterfall` — every registered consumer runs; one consumer's failure is
 *   isolated and does not stop the chain.
 * - `bail` — the event carries an obligation: a consumer's failure stops the
 *   flow and surfaces (fail-fast, never silently dropped).
 *
 * The table is keyed by event *family* (the first dotted segment, or the whole
 * type for unnamespaced ones), so a new family in the union fails compilation
 * until its mode is declared — that is the mechanical cross-check: the mode
 * decision happens when the event is created, not after.
 *
 * Honesty note on the current values: every family is `emit` because that is
 * what the runtime does today — events are appended to the journal and
 * fan out to observers without any consumer able to stop the publisher. The
 * deviation slots (`bail` for the obligation-carrying families, `waterfall`
 * where several consumers must all see an event) are flipped by the
 * generation machine, whose verification pipe is the first consumer with real
 * bail semantics. Flipping a row before that consumer exists would be a
 * declaration without a meaning.
