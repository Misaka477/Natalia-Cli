/**
 * The plugin-facing contract's freshness gate — the PluginAPI half of the
 * behavioral-compatibility contract (interface spec §1.2). The RuntimeClient
 * side has its in-seat vehicles (api-reference's freshness tests,
 * capabilities' exhaustive check, refusals' completeness check); the
 * plugin-facing surface had none, so "members only add, additions must be
 * optional" was a prose promise with no teeth.
 *
 * This gate parses the source type and pins it: a REMOVAL is red, and a
 * non-optional ADDITION is red — an existing plugin does not pass a new
 * required member, so requiring one is a breaking change wearing an
 * additive costume. A deliberate surface edit updates the golden below,
 * the same way every other inventory in this house is edited.
