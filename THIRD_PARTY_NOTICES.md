# Third-Party Notices

Natalia CLI is licensed under Apache-2.0. It uses the third-party software below. This inventory describes the dependencies locked for the first TypeScript/Bun release. License texts included in installed packages are collected in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`; packages whose npm artifacts omit a standalone license file remain identified there by exact package, version, and declared SPDX license.

## Transitive Dependency Licenses

The locked dependency tree currently contains packages under these licenses:

- MIT
- Apache-2.0
- BSD-2-Clause
- BSD-3-Clause
- ISC
- BlueOak-1.0.0
- CC-BY-4.0 (`caniuse-lite` browser compatibility data)

No GPL, LGPL, or AGPL npm package was identified in the locked dependency tree at the time this notice was prepared.

Before each release, run `npm run licenses:check`. It validates workspace license metadata and regenerates the machine-derived dependency inventory used by the release artifact.

## Vendored Components

Natalia vendors source trees that are compiled into its release artifacts and
therefore must keep their copyright and license notices with every
redistribution.

### WezTerm (Natalia fork)

The interactive terminal host is a patched fork of
[WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm), vendored under
`packages/native-terminal/wezterm` and pinned to upstream commit
`76b606ec597a3c0263fa60321548637451c0a547`. The fork adds an authenticated
input-claim exchange immediately before the pane write path (five files under
`wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/`); the full fork metadata, including build
commands, is recorded in `packages/native-terminal/wezterm-fork.json`.

WezTerm is licensed under the MIT License:

preserved there.

WezTerm bundles the `JetBrains Mono`, `Noto Color Emoji`, and `Roboto` fonts,
and a `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` build limited to icon sets distributed under the
OFL 1.1; the Pomicons set is excluded. Those fonts are distributed under the
SIL Open Font License 1.1, whose text is included in the vendored tree under
`packages/native-terminal/wezterm/assets/fonts`.

## System Components

Natalia invokes or uses system/runtime components that are not incorporated into Natalia source code:

- Bun runtime, primarily MIT with bundled third-party components under their respective licenses.
- Python, PSF License, currently used by the POSIX PTY bridge.
- GNU Bash, GPL-3.0-or-later, invoked as an external process.
- Git, GPL-2.0-only, invoked as an external process.
- SQLite, public domain, accessed through `bun:sqlite`.
- OpenSSL may be invoked by TLS tests and is not a normal runtime requirement.

Redistributors that bundle Bun, Python, Bash, Git, OpenSSL, or another system component with Natalia must also satisfy that component's distribution and source-notice obligations. Calling a separately installed executable does not incorporate that executable into Natalia.
